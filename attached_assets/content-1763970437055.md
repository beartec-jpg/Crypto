# OAuth App Verification Help Center

Learn the process, be compliant, get your app verified

## **OAuth App Verification**

Google uses [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) for user permissions and consent, which enables developers to specify the type, and level of access required for their app to function via strings known as API _scopes_. If your app uses Google APIs to access Google users’ data, it may be subject to a verification process before you publish your app.

Apps that request access to scopes categorized as **_sensitive_** _or_ **_restricted_** must complete Google's OAuth app verification before being granted access. A complete list of Google APIs and their corresponding scopes can be found in the [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes). When you add scopes to your project, scope categories ( **non-sensitive**, **_sensitive,_** or **_restricted)_** are indicated automatically in the [Google Cloud Console](http://console.cloud.google.com/).

If your app utilizes only **_non-sensitive_** scopes, it is not mandatory for your app to complete the app verification process. However, if you want your app to display an app name and logo on the OAuth consent screen, you will need to complete a lighter-weight verification process known as "brand-verification".

For detailed information on the specific verification requirements for **_sensitive_** and **_restricted_** scopes, please refer to the [verification requirements](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13464321) section.

For detailed information on app types that are not subjected to the verification requirements refer to the ["When is verification not needed"](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13464323) section.
