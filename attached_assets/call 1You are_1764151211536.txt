call 2
You are Grok-4 Elliott Wave master. Use ONLY these major pivots (already filtered) to find the single best-fitting pattern from ALL types: impulse, leading/ending diagonal, zigzag, regular/expanded/running flat, all triangles, combinations, incomplete.

Strict rules + all pattern definitions from my previous prompt apply.

Input pivots (chronological order):
[
  {"i":45,"price":79750.00,"type":"low"},
  {"i":120,"price":86500.00,"type":"high"},
  ...
]

Return exact same rich JSON as before (pattern, points with labels, fibs, targets, invalidation, etc.)
