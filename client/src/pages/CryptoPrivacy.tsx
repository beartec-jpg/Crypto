      <Section title="1. Who we are">
        <p>BearTec Crypto is run by {COMPANY_DETAILS} ("BEARTEC", "we", "us"). We are the controller of the personal data described in this policy. Contact: {mail}. ICO registration number: <TBC>ICO registration number</TBC>. We have not appointed a data protection officer because the law does not require one for our activities; Scott Reynolds, director, is responsible for data protection.</p>

            ['Create and run your account; provide charts, indicators, AI analysis and alerts you ask for', 'Contract'],

      <Section title="4. AI analysis">
        <p>When you ask for an AI reading, we send the ticker, timeframe and market data needed for that reading to xAI's API, which generates the text. We do not need to send your name or email for this. The AI is an automated software tool, not a person or an adviser. We do not use it to make decisions about you that have legal or similarly significant effects.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="5. Who we share data with">
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. We use these service providers (processors), which act on our instructions:</p>
        <LegalTable
          head={['Provider', 'Purpose', 'Location']}
          rows={[
            ['Clerk', 'Sign-in and account security', 'USA'],
            ['Stripe', 'Payments and subscription billing. Stripe is also an independent controller for some data (for example fraud prevention)', 'UK/EU and USA'],
            ['Vercel', 'Website hosting, serverless functions and scheduled jobs', 'USA and global edge network'],
            ['Neon', 'Database hosting', <TBC key="neon">region</TBC>],

            ['Browser push services (for example Google, Mozilla, Apple)', 'Delivering push notifications to your browser', 'Various'],
          ]}
        />
        <p>We may also share data with professional advisers, or where the law requires it (for example HMRC, the police or a court order). If BEARTEC is sold or reorganised, data may pass to the new owner under this policy.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="6. International transfers">
        <p>Some providers process data outside the UK, mainly in the USA. Where they do, we rely on UK adequacy regulations (including the UK extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework where the provider is certified) or on the ICO's International Data Transfer Agreement or UK Addendum to the EU standard contractual clauses. You can ask us for details.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="7. How long we keep it">
        <LegalTable

      <Section title="8. Your rights">
        <p>You have the right to access your data, correct it, have it erased, restrict or object to its use (including to direct marketing at any time), and receive it in a portable format. Where we rely on consent, you can withdraw it at any time. To use these rights, email {mail}; we will reply within one month. You can also complain to the Information Commissioner's Office (<a href="https://ico.org.uk" className="text-[#00c4b4] hover:underline" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ico.org.uk</a>, 0303 123 1113), but please contact us first so we can try to help.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="9. Cookies and similar technologies">
        <p>We use only storage that is strictly necessary to provide the service: sign-in session cookies set by Clerk, a cookie that remembers whether the sidebar is open, and browser local storage for your chart settings. These do not need consent. We do not use advertising or analytics cookies. If we add any, we will ask for your consent first.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="10. Security">
        <p>We use encrypted connections (HTTPS), managed sign-in with session checks on every request, access controls and least-privilege keys for our providers. No system is completely secure. If a breach is likely to put you at high risk, we will tell you without undue delay and report it to the ICO where required.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="11. Children">
        <p>BearTec Crypto is for adults aged 18 and over. We do not knowingly collect data from children.</p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="12. Changes">
        <p>We will post any changes here with a new date, and tell you by email or in the app if a change is significant.</p>
